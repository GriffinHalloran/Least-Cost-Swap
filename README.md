# Least-Cost-Swap

This is a program which solves the following problem:

You are given n integers wi(i=0,1,...,n−1) to be sorted in ascending order. You can swap two integers wi and wj. Each swap operation has a cost, which is the sum of the two integers wi+wj. You can perform the operations any number of times.

Write a program which reports the minimal total cost to sort the given integers.

Input
----------
In the first line, an integer n is given. In the second line, n integers wi(i=0,1,2,...n−1) separated by space characters are given.

Output
---------
Print the minimal cost in a line.

Constraints
---------
1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,
0 ≤ wi ≤ 10^4,
wi are all different
